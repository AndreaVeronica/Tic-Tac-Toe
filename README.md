How to play:
Player X picks and avatar. 
Player O picks an avatar. 

Player X goes first. 

The objective of the game is for a player to get three boxes in a row (whether horizontally, vertically, diagonally). Player X starts and each turn is alternated until a winner is declared. If no winner is declared and all boxes are filled with a play, the game ends in Draw. 

Project Notes:

I made this game to complete the project one requirements for the WDI course. 



Technologies Used:

Languages - HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

Future Developments:

I have future plans to add a color option for the game pieces. The player will be able to pick x or o as well as a color style for their piece. The game will also log user names rather than listing "Player X: and Player O: "
